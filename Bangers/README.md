# Bangers

`B`eyond `A` `N`ucleotide `G`enerated `E`valuation of `R`elationships between `S`equences.

This is a project of Mike and Rob, and you should probably ignore it.

If you want to play, compile like so:

```
gcc -Wall -o bangers bangers.c -lz
```

and run like so:

```
./bangers JQ995537.faa.gz
```

It will convert amino acid strings into something else
